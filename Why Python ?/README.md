## Why Do People Use Python?

### Software quality
For many, Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general
sets it apart from other tools in the scripting world. Python code is designed to be
readable, and hence reusable and maintainable—much more so than traditional
scripting languages. The uniformity of Python code makes it easy to understand,
even if you did not write it. In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced
software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented (OO) and function programming.

### Developer productivity
Python boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically
typed languages such as C, C++, and Java. Python code is typically one-third to
one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code. That means there is less to type,
less to debug, and less to maintain after the fact. Python programs also run immediately, 
without the lengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools,
further boosting programmer speed.

### Program portability
Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms. Porting
Python code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of
copying a script’s code between machines. Moreover, Python offers multiple op-
tions for coding portable graphical user interfaces, database access programs, web-
based systems, and more. Even operating system interfaces, including program
launches and directory processing, are as portable in Python as they can possibly
be.
### Support libraries
Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known
as the standard library. This library supports an array of application-level pro-
gramming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting. In addition,
Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast collection of
third-party application support software. Python’s third-party domain offers tools
for website construction, numeric programming, serial port access, game devel-
opment, and much more (see ahead for a sampling). The NumPy extension, for
instance, has been described as a free and more powerful equivalent to the Matlab
numeric programming system.
### Component integration
Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a
variety of integration mechanisms. Such integrations allow Python to be used as a
product customization and extension tool. Today, Python code can invoke C and
C++ libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs, can integrate with Java
and .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM and Sil-
verlight, can interface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks
with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA. It is not a standalone tool.
### Enjoyment
Because of Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of pro-
gramming more pleasure than chore. Although this may be an intangible benefit,
its effect on productivity is an important asset.


## Power of Python 

### Dynamic typing
Python keeps track of the kinds of objects your program uses when it runs; it
doesn’t require complicated type and size declarations in your code. In fact, as
you’ll see in Chapter 6, there is no such thing as a type or variable declaration
anywhere in Python. Because Python code does not constrain data types, it is also
usually automatically applicable to a whole range of objects.

### Automatic memory management
Python automatically allocates objects and reclaims (“garbage collects”) them
when they are no longer used, and most can grow and shrink on demand. As you’ll
learn, Python keeps track of low-level memory details so you don’t have to.

### Programming-in-the-large support
For building larger systems, Python includes tools such as modules, classes, and
exceptions. These tools allow you to organize systems into components, use OOP
to reuse and customize code, and handle events and errors gracefully. Python’s
functional programming tools, described earlier, provide additional ways to meet
many of the same goals.

### Built-in object types
Python provides commonly used data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and
strings as intrinsic parts of the language; as you’ll see, they’re both flexible and easy
to use. For instance, built-in objects can grow and shrink on demand, can be ar-
bitrarily nested to represent complex information, and more.

### Built-in tools
To process all those object types, Python comes with powerful and standard op-
erations, including concatenation (joining collections), slicing (extracting sec-
tions), sorting, mapping, and more.

### Library utilities
For more specific tasks, Python also comes with a large collection of precoded
library tools that support everything from regular expression matching to net-
working. Once you learn the language itself, Python’s library tools are where much
of the application-level action occurs.

### Third-party utilities
Because Python is open source, developers are encouraged to contribute precoded
tools that support tasks beyond those supported by its built-ins; on the Web, you’ll
find free support for COM, imaging, numeric programming, XML, database ac-
cess, and much more.
